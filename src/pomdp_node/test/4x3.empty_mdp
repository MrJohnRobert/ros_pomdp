# FILENAME: 4x3.POMDP

# Stuart Russell's 4x3 maze
#
# The maze looks like this:
#
#
#   ######
#   #   +#
#   # # -#
#   #    #
#   ######
#
# The + indicates a reward of 1.0, the - a penalty of -1.0.
# The # in the middle of the maze is an obstruction.
# Rewards and penalties are associated with states, not actions.
# The default reward/penalty is -0.04.
# There is no discounting, but a there is an absorbing state that
# + and - transition to automatically.  The absorbing state cannot be exited.
#
# States are numbered from left to right:
#
# 0  1  2  3
# 4     5  6
# 7  8  9  10
#
# I removed the absorbing state
#
# The actions, NSEW, have the expected result 80% of the time, and
# transition in a direction perpendicular to the intended on with a 10%
# probability for each direction.  Movement into a wall returns the agent
# to its original state.
#
# Observation is limited to two wall detectors that can detect when a
# a wall is to the left or right.  This gives the following possible
# observations:
#
# left, right, neither, both, good, bad, and absorb
#
# good = +1 reward, bad = -1 penalty,
